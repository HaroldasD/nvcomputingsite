# Introduction

Formally known as the American Computer Science League, ACSL is a computer science competition consisting of 4 contests and a final All-Star contest (if our cumulative scores are high enough). 
There are 5 different levels of difficulty, although this team will focus on the Intermediate and Senior levels.

## Basics

ACSL is a contest that focuses on around a dozen different concepts of computer science. 

## Contest Format

There will always be 2 parts to any contest: short answer and programming. For the short answer section, 
you will have 30 minutes to answer 5 questions; we do this during some of our meetings. As for the programming section, you will have 3 days to complete one program (in any programming language you want) at home. The short answer and programming sections both contribute 5 points each, thus making the highest score you can get for any given contest a 10.

For the All-Star contest, there are still 2 parts to it. However, for the programming section, you work with a team for 4 hours on a multitude of programs. As for the short answer portion, you will have 1 hour to do 12 questions instead; you will have to be proficient in all of the categories tested in the regular contests. Prizes are given to the highest-scoring teams and individuals.

# Programming

## What to Keep In Mind

It's always good to write your code in chunks (specifically as functions/methods, if applicable), as it is easy to lose track of what does what otherwise! It also makes testing easier, as it is harder to find an error in a large block of code than in a smaller block of code. 

Also, just because you are able to solve a problem does not necessarily mean that it's the best answer! Consider the efficiency of your program. Think of time complexity (i.e, the time it takes your algorithm to run) and space complexity (i.e, the amount of space that your algorithm needs to run).

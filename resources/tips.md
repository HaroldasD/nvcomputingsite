# General Tips

- It's always good to write your code in chunks (specifically as functions/methods, if applicable),
as it is easy to lose track of what does what otherwise!
It also makes testing easier, as it is harder to find an error in a
large block of code than in a smaller block of code. 

- Just because you are able to solve a problem does not
necessarily mean that you have the best answer! Consider the efficiency of your program.
Think of time and space efficiency (read [this page](/resources/efficiency) for more details).

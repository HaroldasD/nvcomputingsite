# Lambdas

At first, lambdas may seem like a magical mystery creature that you never want to touch; however, they are
relatively easy to use and are a great addition to your Java toolbelt that will allow you much more
flexibility in your code.

Functional programming is a paradigm of programming (similar to object-oriented programming) where
functions can be passed around as objects.

# Lambdas

This will be an at-length introduction into the world of lambdas.

At first, lambdas may seem like a magical mystery creature that you never want to touch; however, they are
relatively easy to use and are a great addition to your Java toolbelt that will allow you much more
flexibility in your code.

Functional programming is a paradigm of programming (similar to object-oriented programming) where
functions can be passed around as objects.

## What is a lambda?

You can think of a lambda as an "anonymous" function. They were added into Java in Java 8.

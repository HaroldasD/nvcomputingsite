Since we have solutions from a variety of past contests, we have separated the solutions into different pages based on their respective contests:
Please note that we do not have every single problem, so if there's one you'd like us to do please contact us on Discord or email us. Also, if
you would like to add a solution that is missing, feel free to do so, but contact us as well.

Solution (in *language used*):
```java
//The example is in Java for simplicity.
import java.util.*;
public class Solution
{
    public static void main(String args[])
    {
        Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
        System.out.println(sc.nextInt());
    }
}
```
What this code does:

*This will try to explain the solution in plain English.*

Efficiency:
*This will be written in big O notation. More information about big O notation can be found [here](/resources/efficiency).*

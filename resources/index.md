# Index

This is the resources page for the Neuqua Valley Computing Team.

You can find a lot of information about different contests, useful tips and tricks for those contests, and introductions
to many different techniques that are useful in competitive programming.

**Please help with the resources! If you think anything can be improved in any way, or if you'd just like to write resource pages, head to the
website's GitHub Repository and check the Guide to Contributing. Any revisions will be reviewed by the captains
and accepted if they're good.**

This page contains general information and useful links, if that's what you're looking for.

Otherwise, click one of the above links you're interested in to get started!

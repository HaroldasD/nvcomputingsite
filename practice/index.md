## Past Homework

This section is temporarily empty. We will begin to post regularly once our computing season begins.

## Do your practice!

We will be keeping track of who does and who doesn't do their practice. This will greatly influence our decisions
for who to bring to programming competitions and who to put on the senior team for ACSL, as students who
do their work are most likely much more motivated and prepared for these events.

## Contents

Practice will usually consist of a few short-answer problems relating to our short-answer topic. Solutions will be posted the week after; please ask questions
via Discord, Remind, or email if you do not understand a problem, as we want to make sure you are as successful as you can be!

## Submission

We will not make submission a requirement. However, we will ask at the start of our meetings who did or did not do the homework just to get a head count;
please be honest when we do so.

## Do your practice!

We will be keeping track of who does and who doesn't do their practice. This will greatly influence our decisions
for who to bring to programming competitions and who to put on the senior team for ACSL. Students who
do their work are most likely much more motivated and prepared for these events.

(To the two geniuses who think they can breeze by without doing any practice: I was in your position 3 years ago. Figuring out how 
some topics really work during the contest itself isn't fun. Figure it out before you actually do any contests. -past captain Raymond)

## Contents

Practice will usually consist of a few short-answer problems relating to our short-answer topic. Solutions will be posted the week after; please ask questions
via Discord, Remind, or email if you do not understand a problem, as we want to make sure you are as successful as you can be!

## Submission

We will not make submission a requirement. However, we will ask at the start of our meetings who did or did not do the homework just to get a head count;
please be honest when we do so.

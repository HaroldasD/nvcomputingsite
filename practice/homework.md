# Homework

Welcome to the homework page! Here you can find the current homework and past homework problems and solutions.

## Do your practice!

We will be keeping track of who does and who doesn't do their practice. This will greatly influence our decisions
for who to bring to programming competitions and who to put on the senior team for ACSL. Students who
do their work are most likely much more motivated and prepared for these events.

(To the two geniuses who think they can breeze by without doing any practice: I was in your position 3 years ago. Figuring out how
some topics really work during the contest itself isn't fun. Figure it out before you actually do any contests. -past captain Raymond)

## Contents

Practice will usually consist of a few short-answer problems relating to our short-answer topic. You should not use any calculators or any websites to help you,
as you won't have these resources during the actual contest.

Solutions will be posted the week after; please ask questions
via Discord, Remind, or email if you do not understand a problem, as we want to make sure you are as successful as you can be!


## This Week's Homework
None, good luck on ACSL!

## Submission

A submission form will be included with each homework assignment. On this submission form, you will be submitting both your answers for the short answer
problems and also a picture of your accepted code submission. The latter should look something like this:

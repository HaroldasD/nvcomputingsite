## Problem 1
Given the mathematical function below find the value of f(16,000)

   f(x)=
   
   f(x/4)+12;       when x>=40
    
   4x;		when 25<x<40
    
   f(x+3)-1;	when x<=25 
    
## Problem 2
Given that f(21)=13, find c in the mathematical function below:

   f(x)=
   
   f(x-6)+4;	when x>=15
   
   x-c;		when 10<x<15
   
   f(x+3)-12;	when x<=10


## Problem 3
Given the mathematical function below, find the value of f(32, 14):
Note: round sqrt x down to the nearest integer.

   f(x)=
   
   f(3*x^(1/2), y+1)-f(x/2, y+1);   when x>y
   
   f(x,y)=	x*y;			when x<=y

## Problem 4
Given the mathematical function below, find f(32):

   f(x)=
   
   f(x-4)+4;		when x>=15
   
   f(x-1)+1;	        when 10<=x<15
   
   2x;			when x<10

## Challenge Question 1
 Given the function below, find f(20,15)
 
f(x,y)= 

1;                         when x+y=2

x*y*f(x-1,y);              when y=1 and x>1

f(x,1)/(f(y,1)*f(x-y,1));  when y>1

## Challenge Question 2
 Given the function below, find f(20,15)
 
f(x,y)= 

1;                            when x+y=2
	
   x*y*f(x-1,y);              when y=1 and x>1
    
f(x,1)/(f(y,1)*f(x-y,1));  when y>1


## Practice Programming Problem
For this week, there is one problem:

[Factorial](https://codeforces.com/problemset/problem/64/A)

Solve this problem and submit your answer to Codeforces (contact the captains if you have any issues with Codeforces).

### Submission Instructions

Click the link and solve the problem in your IDE and language of choice. After you finish the problem, submit your code.
The submit button is in the top left (next to Problems).

As proof of your submission, provide us a screenshot that looks somewhat like the following:

(Header columns are not required - just the data underneath the headers. Any screenshot is fine, as long as it shows
the necessary data - it can be of your whole screen.)

(We won't check your code - just your submission.)
